# Docker Workshop Starter
A simple starter repo to fork for learning docker.

## Introduction
to start this workshop you will need to have already installed docker on your operating system and have a working install. You can test this by running:
```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 80:8988 tutum/hello-world
curl http://localhost:8988/
```
The end result should give you back:
```bash
Hello world!
```
if this is the case then you have a working docker installation.
then to clean up we will use some more docker commands in the workshop.
